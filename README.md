# Application technologies:

Vite + React + Zustand + Typescript + styled-components

The app works as Google currency converter.

# How to install the app:

once the code is downloaded,
open the terminal from the repo folder and run:
``npm i``
``npm run dev``

# Application architecture:

## API
 -- base:
 the wrapper for api calls, where we update requests with global data or environment variables.
 -- converter:
 converter related api.

## Components
 - converter:
 files related, to converter feature;
 - shared:
 agnostic reusable components;

 if new features will be added new folders with descriptive names will be created.

 ## models
 currently only for currency data

 ## stores
Currently only for currency data. All logic is here and in utils - it is easier to test it separately from components.
I also consider it a good idea to manage data flow in zustand - it is lightweight and helps to avoid prop drilling and reduces rerenders.

Currently there are 2 currency selectors and quite similar functions to convert them.

 ## utils
 data transform and data validation, separated here for easier tests in the future
